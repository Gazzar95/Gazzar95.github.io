Hello friends,

## About Me
My name is Omar, and I’m an engineer with five years of experience in the space and defense industry. I was born in New York, raised in Egypt until the age of 16, and then moved to Houston, TX.

People would probably say that my curiosity and excitability are two of my defining traits. If I had to guess, I’d say I’m at least two standard deviations above the mean in **Openness to Experience** (as defined by the Five-Factor Model). Lately, that openness has manifested in a deep and persistent interest in robotics...which brings us here!

## About the Blog
Over the past few months, I’ve spent most of my evenings and weekends diving into robotics. I wanted a space to share what I’m learning, document my progress, reflect on challenges, and connect with others. Here’s what I hope to get out of this blog:

- **Make friends.** I’d love to plug into a community of people with similar interests. Sharing what I’m working on might help spark those connections.
  
- **Structure my thoughts and ideas.** Writing demands a kind of clarity that thinking alone doesn’t. I think putting ideas into words will help me understand obstacles better, and better formulate my world model.
  
- **Share my projects.** it’s just fun to show off things you’ve worked hard on. Some primitive mechanism in the brain probably makes that rewarding. Glorified peacocking? Maybe.
  
- **Document my journey.** I want to look back and see the evolution: what I was building, struggling with, learning, and thinking at each stage.

This interest in robotics has already lasted a few months, which is usually a good sign for me. I'll aim to post once or twice a month, especially when I hit key milestones or complete new projects.

Looking forward to this. Until next time!
